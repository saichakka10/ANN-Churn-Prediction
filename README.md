# Churn Prediction Project
This project predicts customer churn using an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained on a dataset with features such as geography, gender, age, balance, credit score, tenure, number of products, has credit card, isActiveMember, estimated salary, and exit status. After thorough preprocessing, including feature scaling and encoding, the ANN model was developed to classify customers as likely to churn or retain. The solution is deployed on Streamlit Cloud, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time churn predictions, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.
